Introduction
This project is designed to provide a comprehensive backend solution for managing courses and lessons. The implementation includes user registration and authentication, course creation and management, and search functionality, with a focus on security and performance.

Setup Instructions
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Node.js (v14+)
npm (v6+)
SQLite3 (or any other preferred database)
Git
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:

plaintext
Copy code
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_DIALECT=sqlite
DB_STORAGE=./database.sqlite
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT=5000
Run database migrations:

bash
Copy code
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
Start the server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The server should now be running on http://localhost:5000.

Assumptions and Decisions
Database: SQLite was chosen for simplicity and ease of setup during development. The setup can easily be switched to a more robust database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
Validation: The express-validator package was used for input validation to ensure data integrity.
Caching: NodeCache was implemented to improve performance for frequently accessed data.
Security: JWT (JSON Web Token) was used for authentication, ensuring secure API endpoints.
Approach and Design
Database Design and Schema
User Table: Stores user details, including username, email, and hashed passwords.
Course Table: Stores information about each course, including title and description.
Lesson Table: Each lesson is linked to a specific course via a foreign key.
The database schema was designed with simplicity and normalization in mind, ensuring that data is stored efficiently and relationships between tables are clearly defined.

Security and Performance
Authentication: JWT-based authentication ensures secure API access, with tokens being signed using a secret key.
Input Validation: express-validator was used to validate user inputs, protecting the application from common vulnerabilities like SQL injection.
Caching: NodeCache was implemented to store frequently accessed data (e.g., course listings) to reduce database load and improve response times.
Challenges and Solutions
Database Migration: Managing database migrations and ensuring consistency across different environments was a challenge, which was solved by carefully structuring migration files and running tests after each migration.
Security: Ensuring that all API endpoints are secure, especially handling authentication tokens, was a key focus. Implementing JWT with proper expiration times and validation checks helped secure the application.
Performance Optimization: Caching was a critical step in optimizing the performance of the application. By caching frequently accessed data, the load on the database was reduced, resulting in faster API responses.
